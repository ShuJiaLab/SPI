# SPI Image Reconstruction
This project focuses on the reconstruction pipeline of images obtained from the Super-resolution Panoramic Integration (SPI) Microscopy. 
The code follows three main steps: 
1. 1D stitching of swept fields of view (FOV)
2. Crop unnecessary FOV & FPN removal
3. (Optional) Large FOV formation for raster-scanned images
4. Upscaling
5. WB Deconvolution
